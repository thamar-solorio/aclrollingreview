As promised in our blog entry for August, ACL has established an ARR board that will oversee the 
activities of ARR. We suggest readers go back to [that blog entry](https://aclrollingreview.org/changes-based-on-the-ACL-reviewing-survey/)
for more information on the responsibilities of the board. In this update to the community we would 
like to formally welcome the founding members of the ARR Board:

- Julia Hockenmaier, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA
- Yusuke Miyao, The University of Tokyo, Japan
- Smaranda Muresan, Columbia University, USA
- Thamar Solorio, University of Houston, USA

The board is just getting settled into their new roles so please be patient while this happens and be on 
the lookout for more information from them in the near future. We expect their roles to also adjust with 
time as we form a better understanding on how this board can support the needs of the ACL community. For 
now, letâ€™s just welcome them and thank them for their willingness to volunteer in this capacity.
